## 🚀 How to Install (Development Build)

⚠️ **Note:** Please disable any mods that affect taskbar height or taskbar icons—this mod already includes those
features.
1. [Install Windhawk](https://windhawk.net/) if you haven't already.
2. Copy the contents of [
   `assembled-mod.cpp`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DarkionAvey/windhawk-taskbar-centered-condensed/main/assembled-mod.cpp)
   to your clipboard.
3. Open **WindHawk** and navigate to: `Explore` → `Create a new mod`.
4. Press `Ctrl+A` to select all, then `Ctrl+V` to paste.
5. Click **Compile Mod** button on the top left corner.
6. Change the mod's settings to fit your preference.
7. If your explorer.exe is not responding, disable the mod from Windhawk, open task manager, restart explorer.exe, wait
   for the default taskbar to appear, then apply WinDock.

## 🛠 Source Code

The actual mod code is split into files under [
`mod-parts/`](https://github.com/DarkionAvey/windhawk-taskbar-centered-condensed/blob/main/mod-parts/), which are later merged together using a Python script.

❗ **Do not edit `assembled-mod.cpp` manually**, as any changes will be overwritten in the next build cycle. Instead,
modify the source files in the `mod-parts` directory.

## 🛣️ To-do

1. Proper unloading
2. Fix overflowing
3. ~~Rebrand because someone claimed the name WinDock~~
