# windhawk-taskbar-centered-condensed
Moves the tray area next to the task area of the taskbar, for Windows 11. Heavily based on m417z code


# Warning ⚠️
There is a bug when you use vertical offset and not set your taskbar to auto hide. To fix, either set your taskbar to auto hide from Windows Settings, or set the offset to 0.

# How to install
Copy `main.cpp` contents to clipboard, then go to WindHawk > Explore > Create a new mod > Compile Mod

# Getting started
This mod tries to turn Windows 11 taskbar into MacOS-like dock with proper smooth animations without sacrificing the funcitonality of the default taskbar as when using custom apps. It is currently under development. Pull requests are welcome

# Credits
This mod wouldn't have been possible without `m417z`'s mods, so many thanks to him!
